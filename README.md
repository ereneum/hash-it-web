# Hash It!

Hash It is a simple Flask site that takes input, converts it to SHA256 and mixes it.

It takes your input, takes as many characters as you want from the beginning and the end, puts "!" between and capitalizes the first string character. You can specify the order.


## How to Use?

1.  Write the text you want to use as input.

2. Write how many characters you want to get from the beginning of the resulting SHA256 hash.

3. Write how many characters you want to get from the end of the resulting SHA256 hash.

4. If you want the result to be "FirstCharacters!LastCharacters", leave the checkbox unchecked. If you want it to be "LastCharacters!FirstCharacters", check the checkbox.
